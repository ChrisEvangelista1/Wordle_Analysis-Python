# Wordle_Analysis-Python
Wordle is a popular daily word puzzle hosted by The New York Times.  The objective of the game is to guess the daily word within six attempts, with clues given after each guess.  The game gained its mainstream popularity after the ability for individuals to share their results as emoji squares on social media sites such as Twitter.  It is this data, 1.1 million tweets pulled and collected in Kaggle, that will be the foundation of this projects analytics.  This projects analyzes the tweet data to answer questions pertaining things such as difficulty.  There is also a Wordle solver that provides all valid Wordle answer that can be used when stuck!

The primary purpose of this project is to hone skills with Python pandas and matplotlib/seaborn, particularily coding with method chaining; however, answering questions i've long had since first playing the game is a fun bonus!
